<p>
    Medical surveillance should not be used as a tool to discover hazards That should happen through hazard identification and risk assessments Medical surveillance should be to ensure that control and prevention measures are working properly Medical surveillance should be seen to evaluate the success of the prevention measures implemented and be the basis to consider the implementation of additional measures as required.
